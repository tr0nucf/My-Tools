2 - Networking: 
	2.1 Protocols
	
	ISO/OSI Model
	Application
	Presentation
	Session
	Transport
	Network
	Data Link
	Physical
	
	Reserved IP Addresses
		0.0.0.0 - 0.255.255.255
		127.0.0.0 127.255.255.255
		192.168.0.0 - 194.168.255.255 Class B reserved
		
	Routing
		ip route
		route print
	Routers with IP addresses.
	Switches woh with MAC addresses.  - ARP
	
	TCP - Guaranteed delivery
			Connection Orriented
			Lower Throughput
		3-Way Handshake
		
			SYN (Seq A, Ack 0)
			SYN+ACK(Seq B, Ack A+1)
			ACK (Seq A+2, Ack B+1
			
	UDP - Non guarenteed
			Connectionless. 
			Better throughput
	
	Ports
		25 - SMTP
		22 - SSH
		80 - HTTP
		110 - POP3
		143 - IMAP
		443 - HTTPS
		137,138,139 - NetBios
		115 - SFTP
		23  - Telnet
		21 - FTP
		3389 - RDP
		3309 - MySQL
		1433 - MS SQL Server
		
	Netstat for current TCP connections. 
	
	IDS - Check Payload
		NIDS - Network Intrustion Detection Systems (Typically on Router)
		HIDS - Host Intrustion Detection Systems (Application logs,file-system etc)
		
	IPS - Intrusion Prevention Systems
		Drop malicious requests. 
	
	NAT - reqrites souce IP typcially on Internet connections. Computer must use it as the default gateway. 
	
	DNS
	Convert Name to IP Addresses
		- Top Level Domain - TLD
		- Domain 
		- Sub Domain
		- Host name
	Reverse DNS - Ip to Name (If Admin configured)
	
	
	
3. Web Applicaitons
	HTTP Basics
	Stateless - Made staefull by use of cookies on the client side
	Sessions on the server side. 
	Client/Server exchange messages
